Here is the purpose of making this project :
- Create a library (library or package) in Java to find SPL solutions using the Gauss elimination method, Gauss-Jordan elimination method, inverse matrix method, and Cramer's rule (Cramer's rule specifically for SPL with n variables and n equations), calculating the matrix determinant using row reduction and with cofactor expansion, and calculating matrix inverses.
- Solve various problems in SPL form, solve interpolation and linear regression problems, calculate inverse matrices, calculate matrix determinants using various methods (row reduction and cofactor expansion).

### Built With
- [Java Programming Language](https://www.java.com/)

## Prerequisites

List any prerequisites that are required to run your Java program. For example:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## Installation

If you want to run this program you will need to set up 

1. Clone this repository :
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Filbert88/TUBES-ALGEO-1/
```

2. Build / Compile java program :
```shell
./Build
```
Or you can just double click Build file in first directory

3. Run the program :
```shell
./App
```
Or you can just double click App file in first directory

## Features

Here is the purpose of making this project :
* The program contains of menu options (SPL, Determinant, Inverse, Interpolation Polynomial & Bicubic Spline, and Regression)
* The program can receive input either from the keyboard (terminal) or read input from text files.
* Step by step how to get the answer
* File output (file.txt)
* Each menu contains various problem solving methods

## File Structures

This repo contains of 4 folders such as :
- bin : contains of java executable file .class that has been compiled from the src folder
- src : contains of main program source code .java 
- doc : contain of our assignment report
- test : contains of study cases problems that can be used as an input in the program.
 - output : contains of output .txt file based on users
